Today I started JavaScript Again from scratch from www.javascript.info and learnt some articles.. and came to know some stuff.
- As a rule, only the simplest scripts are put into HTML. More complex ones reside in separate files.
The benefit of a separate file is that the browser will download it and store it in its cache.
Other pages that reference the same script will take it from the cache instead of downloading it, so the file is actually downloaded only once.
That reduces traffic and makes pages faster.

-If src is set, the script content is ignored.
<script src="file.js">
  alert(1); // the content is ignored, because src is set
</script>

- The directive looks like a string: "use strict" or 'use strict'. When it is located at the top of a script, the whole script works the “modern” way.

- `How are you ${1+2}` Backticks..


 And solved One problem in codefocres but got stuck so bad in second one and lost 2 hours for it.. It was a mistake it was only implementation problem and I didn't do it.
