/* Today I learnt about function and arrow function with detailed information about basics of function expressions and function declarations and solved 3 problems in codeforces. */

function showMessage(from, text = anotherFunction()) {
  // anotherFunction() only executed if no text given
  // its result becomes the value of text
}
// if there's no "count" parameter, show "unknown"
function showCount(count) {
  alert(count ?? "unknown");
} 



function sayHi() {
  // ...
}

let sayHi = function() {
  // ...
};

    There’s no need for ; at the end of code blocks and syntax structures that use them like if { ... }, for { }, function f { } etc.
    A Function Expression is used inside the statement: let sayHi = ...;, as a value. It’s not a code block, but rather an assignment. The semicolon ; is recommended at the end of statements, no matter what the value is. So the semicolon here is not related to the Function Expression itself, it just terminates the statement.

function ask(question, yes, no) {
  if (confirm(question)) yes()
  else no();
}

ask(
  "Do you agree?",
  function() { alert("You agreed."); },
  function() { alert("You canceled the execution."); }
);

As a rule of thumb, when we need to declare a function, the first to consider is Function Declaration syntax. It gives more freedom in how to organize our code, because we can call such functions before they are declared.

That’s also better for readability, as it’s easier to look up function f(…) {…} in the code than let f = function(…) {…};. Function Declarations are more “eye-catching”.

…But if a Function Declaration does not suit us for some reason, or we need a conditional declaration (we’ve just seen an example), then Function Expression should be used.

Arrow functions are handy for one-liners. They come in two flavors:

    Without curly braces: (...args) => expression – the right side is an expression: the function evaluates it and returns the result.
    With curly braces: (...args) => { body } – brackets allow us to write multiple statements inside the function, but we need an explicit return to return something.
